# TRIANGLE TRACKER.
## Author: KAMADI DOUGLAS.
# Description
### Triangle Tracker takes the lengths of three sides of a triangle and determines if they form a valid triangle. If so, the tracker returns the name of the kind of triangle the sides make (equilateral, isosceles, scalene). This is an example of refactoring a single function into a few functions to DRY the code and make it more readable.
